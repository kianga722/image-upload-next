# image-upload

Image gallery and upload app frontend

## Summary

- Built using Next, TypeScript, MSW and Emotion
- Implementations using Context and Redux
- Differences from the [create-react-app implementation](https://github.com/kianga722/image-upload-react) include having to setup React Testing Library more manually (Installing Jest environment, fetch polyfills, etc) and using MSW as a client component (since Next is running on server by default)
